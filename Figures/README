Files and scripts needed for paper specific analysis

Bins*common.tsv are the bins used for comparison analysis between resolutions. These bins include only genomic regions that were covered at all resolution. 

HCT116_CellCycleInfo.tsv gives cell sort information per HCT cell library

dna_llr.smk is a snakemake rule that can be inserted into workflow/rules if downsampling is supposed to be performed before llr segmentation

LLR_diff_Reference.R shows how difference between reference and llr downsampling was calculated. mpcf difference from reference was calculated the same way 

so_simulations are the calculations performed to simulate standardized overlaps at different noise levels and different number of basepairs. 

Bincounts file includes bincounts of HCT116 and ALL40 cells (raw data for HCT116 cells will be freely available on sra with accession number PRJNA1263634 at the time of publication).
